# Your first homework assignment
Try as hard as you can (ping us on slack if need be) to complete this lesson.  To complete it, you'll need to download it to your computer and upload it to your jupyter notebook.  To do that you'll have to figure out a bunch of things, like how to start up Jupyter!  But that's the point.  And if you can't figure it out, don't panic; we can run through it in class during the second hour of the next class.  Good luck, and please join slack to communicate with us and your fellow students!

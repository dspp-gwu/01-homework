# Your first homework assignment
Try as hard as you can (ping us on slack if need be) to complete this lesson.  To complete it, you'll need to download the file "lesson_01.ipynb" to your computer and upload it to your jupyter notebook.  To do that you'll have to figure out a bunch of things, like how to start up Jupyter!  How to download the repo (hint: go [here](https://github.com/dspp-gwu/01-homework), and click on the green "clone or download" button, the choose to download the zip file).  

But figuring out some of this on your own or with help is the point.  And if you can't figure it out, don't panic; we can run through it in class during the second hour of the next class.  Good luck, and please join slack to communicate with us and your fellow students!
